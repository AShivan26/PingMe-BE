# CashCard Service #

`#JAVA` `#SPRING`

Maintained by aniruddhams2023@gmail.com [Aniruddha Shivananda]

This project provides the backend service necessary for the cashcard API.

# Java Version

Default Java Version -  **22**.

1.I have taken TDD(Test Driven Development) approach on development of the project
this is mainly because by asserting expected behavior before implementing the desired 
functionality, weâ€™re designing the system based on what we want it to do, rather than what
the system already does.
